## Data Cleaning

Collaboration with our team, GraphGurus: 
- Performed by Francisco Lozano: KNN Imputation to clean missing square footage, # of stories, and year built.
- Performed by Ken Vellian: Extract address information, through regular expressions, from the URL column to create the new street address, city, state, and zip columns. Extract square footage and acre size, through regular expressions, from the text column and fill in missing square footage values.
